# Closure Implementation Status - Detailed Plan

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of closure support in the Roc interpreter, including lessons learned and remaining work needed to achieve full Lambda Evaluation with Closure Captures.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Unified Closure Type
- **Before**: Had separate `SimpleClosure` and `Closure` types
- **After**: Single `Closure` type that handles both simple and capturing closures
- **Benefit**: Simplified code, eliminated type confusion

### 2. Call Frame Marker System
- **Implemented**: `CallFrame` struct that stores function position and metadata during calls
- **Purpose**: Eliminates complex backward calculation of closure positions
- **Trade-off**: ~24 bytes per call for much simpler, more robust code

### 3. Direct vs Indirect Call Handling
- **Direct calls**: `(|x| x + 1)(5)` - calling a lambda expression directly
- **Indirect calls**: `f(5)` where `f` is a closure value on the stack
- **Key insight**: Only direct calls need call frames; indirect calls already have complete closure values

### 4. Fixed Critical Bugs
- Duplicate work item scheduling causing function bodies to execute multiple times
- Call frame layout being pushed as closure layout
- Hardcoded closure size of 12 bytes not accounting for captured environment
- Incorrect position calculations for returned closures

## Lessons Learned

### 1. State Management is Error-Prone
The original `last_closure_pos` approach failed because:
- Global state doesn't work with nested/recursive calls
- Position tracking gets out of sync with actual stack state
- **Lesson**: Prefer explicit data (call frames) over implicit state

### 2. Work Item Scheduling Must Be Centralized
Having multiple places schedule the same work items led to:
- Duplicate execution of function bodies
- Layout stack corruption
- Confusing control flow
- **Lesson**: One component should own the scheduling for each operation

### 3. Layout and Memory Must Stay Synchronized
Mismatches between layout sizes and actual allocated sizes caused:
- Wrong position calculations
- Reading garbage data
- Stack corruption
- **Lesson**: The layout system must accurately represent actual memory usage

### 4. Debugging Infrastructure is Critical
The comprehensive tracing system was essential for:
- Understanding complex call sequences
- Tracking stack and layout state
- Identifying where things diverged from expectations
- **Lesson**: Invest in debugging tools early

### 5. Test-Driven Fixes Work Well
Starting with 9 failing tests and systematically fixing them:
- Provided clear progress indicators
- Helped identify patterns in failures
- Prevented regression
- **Lesson**: Good test coverage makes complex refactoring manageable

## Current Status

### Working ✅
- Basic lambda creation and evaluation
- Direct lambda calls with call frame tracking
- Indirect closure calls (calling returned closures)
- Nested closures that return closures
- Stack cleanup and layout synchronization
- Parameter binding for direct arguments

### Not Working ❌
- Closure captures (currently creates empty environments)
- Variable lookup from captured environments
- Memory aliasing issue in parameter copying
- Complex nested closures with multiple levels of capture

### Test Results
- **Before**: 9 tests failing
- **After**: 1 test failing ("lambda expressions comprehensive")
- **Remaining failure**: Returns garbage value (79228162514264337593543950341) instead of 6

## Root Cause Analysis

The remaining test failure reveals two core issues:

### 1. Empty Captured Environments
```zig
const captured_env = CapturedEnvironment{
    .bindings = &.{}, // Empty for now
    .parent_env = null,
    .deferred_init = lambda_expr.captures.captured_vars.len > 0,
};
```
We're not actually capturing values, just creating placeholder environments.

### 2. Memory Aliasing in Variable Lookup
```zig
@memcpy(@as([*]u8, @ptrCast(ptr))[0..binding_size], 
        @as([*]u8, @ptrCast(binding.value_ptr))[0..binding_size]);
```
The panic indicates source and destination overlap, suggesting the binding system is reusing memory incorrectly.

## Next Steps - Detailed Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Memory Aliasing Issue (High Priority)
1. **Investigate the root cause**:
   - Add bounds checking to ensure ptr and binding.value_ptr don't overlap
   - Trace where binding.value_ptr is set
   - Verify parameter bindings aren't being corrupted

2. **Implement proper copying**:
   ```zig
   // Check for overlap before copying
   const src_start = @intFromPtr(binding.value_ptr);
   const src_end = src_start + binding_size;
   const dst_start = @intFromPtr(ptr);
   const dst_end = dst_start + binding_size;
   
   if ((src_start < dst_end) and (dst_start < src_end)) {
       // Overlapping - use memmove or allocate temporary buffer
       std.mem.copyBackwards(u8, dest, src);
   } else {
       @memcpy(dest, src);
   }
   ```

### Phase 2: Implement Proper Closure Captures
1. **Update `initializeCapturedEnvironment`**:
   - Actually look up and copy captured variable values
   - Store them in the closure's environment
   - Handle nested captures (closures capturing other closures)

2. **Fix `lookupVariable`**:
   - Implement proper search through captured environments
   - Handle parent environment chains
   - Add bounds checking

3. **Update closure size calculation**:
   ```zig
   fn calculateClosureSize(captures: []const CIR.CapturedVar) u32 {
       var size: u32 = 12; // Header size
       for (captures) |capture| {
           // Get actual size of captured value
           const layout = getLayoutForCapture(capture);
           size += layout.size();
       }
       return size;
   }
   ```

### Phase 3: Serialization and Deserialization
1. **Implement `Closure.write` properly**:
   - Write header (body_expr_idx, args_pattern_span)
   - Write captured environment data
   - Handle variable-sized captures

2. **Implement `Closure.read` properly**:
   - Read header
   - Reconstruct captured environment
   - Validate data integrity

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation
1. **Add unit tests for each component**:
   - Closure creation with captures
   - Environment lookup
   - Nested closures
   - Memory management

2. **Add integration tests**:
   - Complex closure scenarios
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Memory leak detection

## Implementation Priority

1. **Immediate (Fix failing test)**:
   - Fix memory aliasing issue
   - Implement basic capture for the simple test case

2. **Short term (Full capture support)**:
   - Complete `initializeCapturedEnvironment`
   - Fix variable lookup
   - Handle all capture scenarios

3. **Medium term (Robustness)**:
   - Add comprehensive error handling
   - Improve debugging output
   - Optimize performance

4. **Long term (Production ready)**:
   - Handle all edge cases
   - Add garbage collection hooks
   - Optimize memory usage

## Technical Debt to Address

1. **Magic numbers**: Replace hardcoded sizes (12, 32) with proper constants
2. **Error handling**: Many `@panic("TODO")` that need implementation
3. **Type safety**: Some unsafe casts that could be made safer
4. **Documentation**: Add comprehensive docs for the capture mechanism

## Success Metrics

- All 482 eval tests passing
- No memory leaks or corruption
- Performance within 2x of baseline
- Clear documentation and examples

# Summary: Progress Towards Lambda Eval with Closure Captures

## Executive Summary

We've made significant progress implementing closure support in the Roc interpreter, reducing test failures from 9 to 1. The architecture for handling both direct lambda calls and indirect closure calls is now solid, with a robust call frame system replacing error-prone global state.

## Key Achievements

✅ **Unified closure type** - Simplified from two types to one  
✅ **Call frame markers** - Reliable position tracking for function calls  
✅ **Direct vs indirect calls** - Proper handling of different call patterns  
✅ **Stack cleanup** - Correct memory management for nested calls  
✅ **Layout synchronization** - Fixed size calculation mismatches  

## Remaining Work

❌ **Closure captures** - Currently using empty placeholder environments  
❌ **Variable lookup** - Not searching captured environments correctly  
❌ **Memory aliasing** - Parameter copying has overlap issues  

## The Path Forward

The foundation is solid. We need to:
1. Fix the immediate memory aliasing issue (few hours)
2. Implement actual value capture (1-2 days)
3. Complete environment serialization (1 day)
4. Test and polish (1 day)

**Estimated completion: 3-5 days of focused work**

The hardest architectural decisions have been made and validated. What remains is largely mechanical implementation of the capture mechanism using the patterns we've established.
